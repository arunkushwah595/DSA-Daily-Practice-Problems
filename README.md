# Daily DSA Practice Problems

## Outcomes

Practicing Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) daily helps build strong problem-solving skills and long-term confidence in coding interviews and competitive programming.  
Hereâ€™s what consistent practice can achieve:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Short-Term Outcomes (Daily â€“ Weekly)
- Develop a **problem-solving habit** and discipline.  
- Improve **logical thinking** and structured approach to problems.  
- Gain **syntax fluency** with cleaner, bug-free code.  
- Build **confidence** by achieving small daily wins.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Medium-Term Outcomes (1â€“3 Months)
- Recognize common **problem patterns** (sliding window, binary search, DP, graphs, etc.).  
- Solve problems **faster and more efficiently**.  
- Strengthen **fundamentals** in arrays, strings, recursion, trees, graphs, DP, and hashing.  
- Sharpen **debugging and edge-case handling** skills.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Long-Term Outcomes (6â€“12 Months)
- Become **interview-ready** for coding rounds and technical assessments.  
- Improve **competitive programming performance** (LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, etc.).  
- Enhance **analytical & critical thinking** for real-world problem-solving.  
- Gain **confidence in core CS concepts** used in placements and hackathons.  
- Build a **portfolio of solved problems** to showcase consistency (LeetCode/GitHub/Profiles).
